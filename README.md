# Kickstarter-analysis--YT

##### The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight into a fund-raising project Louise is managing. We are intending to show trends that will help us analyse the current campaign and plan future similar projects more efficiently. The project emphasizes on fundraising for a production. This analysis tries to answer a series of important questions such as;

- Did it work?
- Did we meet our goal?
- By how much did we exceed or fall short?
- What impact does launch dates have on goals? “what impacts does the projected goal have on success and pledges…etc.?

##### For the first part of the analysis we are only focusing on the theater category and it’s outcome by the launch date. As shown in the line chart, it is evident that the month of May is the most effective month to launch a successful campaigns. The month of June follows a little behind and is also equally a successful month. The least successful month hence is the month of December. To show this a column next to the pivot table is added to indicate percentage of failed campaigns. Though we can not draw a conclusion,  by only basing our analysis on launch period, when answering the question of “did it work”?. This perhaps shows a trend for future planning.

##### On the second part of the analysis, we are focusing on subcategory plays to show the percentage of outcomes based on goals. Though there isn’t much to show a perfect trend we can conclude that the projects with less than $1000 goal have turned a more successful outcome.

##### Doing the analysis, I have not encountered a challenge but I have come across a difficulty, because I had skipped some of the module instructions due to an oversight, and had to do the whole analysis over again. 

##### Some of the possible analysis can be; 

-	Outcome trends through the years: this will help determine which year was the most successful year, what had been done different to get that success. This will help to replicate. 
-	The dollar amount of successul outcomes pledged by the category, by country and subcategory 
-	Average percentage funded by category, subcategory, outcome, and country. We can incorporate this table to the onece that are already developed and make sense by combining multiple indicators 
-	MIN and MAX amount pledged by different criteria such as category, outcome... etc 
-	Top 10 and bottom 10 average funded campaign
